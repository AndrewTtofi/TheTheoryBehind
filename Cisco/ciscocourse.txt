	Intro:
	Computer Network:
		- A computer network is a digital telecommunications network which allows nodes to share resources

	Network Nodes:
		- Router
		- Switch
		- Firewall
		End Hosts:
		- Server
		- Client (Smartphone, pc, tablet)

	Clients:
		A client is a device that accesses a service made available by a server. A client is a device that allows you to access
		the internet (e.g smartphone, tablet, pc, laptop etc)

	Server:
		A server is a device that provides functions or services for clients. A server is a device that provides the requested information 
		from the internet to client (e.g powerful pc, server pc, even a raspberry pie)

	The same Device Can be a Client at some situations and a Server at others.

	Switches:
		Switches are used to aggregate the connection between the computers in a Branch of Offices to create a LAN (Local Area Network).
		Switches also can be used to aggregate the connection between the servers in a Branch to create a LAN 2.
		Switches cannot directly access the internet to communicate between the 2 Offices.
		Switches:
			- They have many network interfaces/ports for end hosts to connect to (usually 24+)
			- They provide connectivity to hosts within the same LAN
			- They DO NOT provide connectivity between LANs/over the Internet

	Router:
		Routers are used to provide access to the internet from the LAN via a Switch. First of all the PCs send the request to the switch.
		The switch then sends the request to the router and the router sends the request to the internet. Then the requests arrive to the router of the server
		the  request was made for. The router of the second LAN sends the requests to the second switch and to the server. Then the respond goes the other way around.
		Routers:
			- Routers have fewer netowrk interfaces than switches
			- Routers are used to provide connectivity between LANs
			- They are used to send data over the internet.

	Firewall:
		Firewalls are network security devices that control network traffic entering and exiting your network. Firewalls can be placed pas the point of router or before the stage of a router. They protect the end hosts inside the network. 
		Firewalls:
			- They monitor and control network traffic based on configured rules
			- They can be placed "inside" the network (after traffic hits the router), or "outside" the network (before the traffic hits the router)
			- "Next Generation Firewalls" they include modern and advanced filtering cababilities.
		Host-Based Firewalls:
			- Host-Based firewalls are installed softwares that monitor the inbound and outbound traffic on your PC. example: Windows Firewall

	Interfaces and Cables:
		Interfaces can also be called ports (on switches). Ethernet ports are called RJ-45 (Registered Jack).
		What is Ethernet? Is a collection of networks protocols/standards.
		Why we need network protocols and standards?
			- Network protocols and standards is like a predefined language in which the devices are going to communicate in. 
			- If you try to connect a cable and a switch if the two vendors go with the ethernet standards that are usually followed then they will not be able to communicate.
		Connection between Devices in a Network:
			- Speeds:
				Connection between devices in a network operate at a set speed.
				The speeds are measured in bits per second or bps. These values are represented by either a 0 or a 1.
				8 bits is equal to 1 byte. The speeds are measured in bits per second and NOT in bytes per second. The reason is that the transfer is reached from the giver to the receiver one bit at a time NOT a byte at a time.
				Speed in networks is measured in Kbps, Mbps, Gbps etc.
				1 Kilobit(Kb)
