	Intro:
	Computer Network:
		- A computer network is a digital telecommunications network which allows nodes to share resources

	Network Nodes:
		- Router
		- Switch
		- Firewall
		End Hosts:
		- Server
		- Client (Smartphone, pc, tablet)

	Clients:
		A client is a device that accesses a service made available by a server. A client is a device that allows you to access
		the internet (e.g smartphone, tablet, pc, laptop etc)

	Server:
		A server is a device that provides functions or services for clients. A server is a device that provides the requested information 
		from the internet to client (e.g powerful pc, server pc, even a raspberry pie)

	The same Device Can be a Client at some situations and a Server at others.

	Switches:
		Switches are used to aggregate the connection between the computers in a Branch of Offices to create a LAN (Local Area Network).
		Switches also can be used to aggregate the connection between the servers in a Branch to create a LAN 2.
		Switches cannot directly access the internet to communicate between the 2 Offices.
		Switches:
			- They have many network interfaces/ports for end hosts to connect to (usually 24+)
			- They provide connectivity to hosts within the same LAN
			- They DO NOT provide connectivity between LANs/over the Internet

	Router:
		Routers are used to provide access to the internet from the LAN via a Switch. First of all the PCs send the request to the switch.
		The switch then sends the request to the router and the router sends the request to the internet. Then the requests arrive to the router of the server
		the  request was made for. The router of the second LAN sends the requests to the second switch and to the server. Then the respond goes the other way around.
		Routers:
			- Routers have fewer netowrk interfaces than switches
			- Routers are used to provide connectivity between LANs
			- They are used to send data over the internet.

	Firewall:
		Firewalls are network security devices that control network traffic entering and exiting your network. Firewalls can be placed pas the point of router or before the stage of a router. They protect the end hosts inside the network. 
		Firewalls:
			- They monitor and control network traffic based on configured rules
			- They can be placed "inside" the network (after traffic hits the router), or "outside" the network (before the traffic hits the router)
			- "Next Generation Firewalls" they include modern and advanced filtering cababilities.
		Host-Based Firewalls:
			- Host-Based firewalls are installed softwares that monitor the inbound and outbound traffic on your PC. example: Windows Firewall

	Interfaces and Cables:
		Interfaces can also be called ports (on switches). Ethernet ports are called RJ-45 (Registered Jack).
		What is Ethernet? Is a collection of networks protocols/standards.
		Why we need network protocols and standards?
			- Network protocols and standards is like a predefined language in which the devices are going to communicate in. 
			- If you try to connect a cable and a switch if the two vendors go with the ethernet standards that are usually followed then they will not be able to communicate.
		Connection between Devices in a Network:
			- Speeds:
				Connection between devices in a network operate at a set speed.
				The speeds are measured in bits per second or bps. These values are represented by either a 0 or a 1.
				8 bits is equal to 1 byte. The speeds are measured in bits per second and NOT in bytes per second. The reason is that the transfer is reached from the giver to the receiver one bit at a time NOT a byte at a time.
				Speed in networks is measured in Kbps, Mbps, Gbps etc.
				1 Kilobit(Kb) = 1,000 bits
				1 Megabit(Mb) = 1,000,000 bits
				1 Gigabit(Gb) = 1,000,000,000 bits
				1 Terabit(Tb) = 1,000,000,000,000 bits

			-Ethernet Standards:
				Defined in the IEEE 802.3 standard in 1983
				IEEE = Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
				
				Speed 				Common Name				IEEE Standards			Infromal Name	(Base = refers to baseband signaling)		Maximum Lenght
				10 Mbps				Ethernet				802.3i					10 BASE-T		(T = twisted pair)							100 m
				100 Mbps			Fast Ethernet			802.3u					100 BASE-T													100 m 
				1 Gbps 				Gigabit Ethernet		802.3ab					1000 BASE-T													100 m	
				10Gbps				10 Gigabiot Ethernet	802.3an					10G  BASE-T													100 m
			
			Cable types:
				-UTP Cables (unshielded twisted pair)
					4 pairs of wires twisted together
					8 wires in total
					10 BASE-T	100 BASE-T use only 2 pairs of the UTP cables 
					1000 BASE-T	10G BASE-T use all of 4 pairs of the UTP cables
					Full-Duplex Transminsion: (Send and receive data at the same time)
						There are in total 8 pins (8 wires in a UTP cable). When a PC is connected to a switch, if the cable is 10 Base-T or 100Base-T it only uses 4 of those pins.
						In order for the computer to Transmit data (Tx), it uses the pins of the cable 1 and 2 which are twisted together and the switch receives (Rx) the data.
						In order for the switch to respond or transmit data (Tx) it uses pins 3 and 6 which the wires are also twisted together and the PC receives the data(Rx).
						This allows the Full-Duplex Transminsion.

					Netowrk Nodes and UTP Cables:
						PC 			(10Base-T + 100Base-T): pins 1+2 transmit data(Tx), pins 3+6 receive data (Rx)
						Router  	(10Base-T + 100Base-T): pins 1+2 transmit data(Tx), pins 3+6 receive data (Rx)
						Firewall	(10Base-T + 100Base-T): pins 1+2 transmit data(Tx), pins 3+6 receive data (Rx)
						Switch  	(10Base-T + 100Base-T): pins 3+6 transmit data(Tx), pins 1+2 receive data (Rx)

					Types of Cables:
						Straight-through cable:
							The cable connects the pins to the corresponding pin of the other device:
								e.g. pin 1 to pin 1, pin 2 to pin 2 etc.
						Crossover Calbe:
							The cable connects the pins to of a router to a router to the following series:
								e.g. pin1 to pin 3, pin2 to pin6, pin3 to pin1 and pin6 to pin2

						Auto MDI-X:
							Auto detects which pins is the neighboor device is receiving and transmitting on.
							And adjust their pins accordingly.

				-Fiber-Optics Connections
					SFP Tranceiver (Small Form-Factor Pluggable)
					Anatomy of a fiber optic cable:
						-Fiberglass core: the section which the data is transmitted
						-Cladding that reflects the light(info trasmitted)
						-A prodective buffer (Protects the fiberglass from breaking)
						-the outer jacket of the cable

						Multimode Fiber Cables:
							-Core diameter is wider than single-mode fiber
							-Allows multiple angles (modes of lights) to enter the fiberglass core
							-Allows longer cables than UTP, but shorter cables than single-mode fiber
							-Cheaper than single-mode fiber (due to cheaper LED-based SFP transmitters)
						
						Single mode fiber:
							-Core diameter is narrower than multimode fiber
							-Light enters at a single angle (mode) froma laser-based transmitter
							-Allows longer cables than both  UTP and multimode fiber
							-More expensive than multimode fiber (due to more expensive laser-based SFP transmitters)

					Fiber-Optic Cable Standards:
						Informal Name			IEEE Standards			Speeds			Cable types			Maximum Lenght
						1000 BASE-LX			802.3z					1Gbps			Multimode or 		550 meters (MM)
																						Single Mode 		5 km (SM)
						10G BASE-SR				802.3ae					10 Gbps			Multimode			400 meters						
						10G BASE-LR				802.3ae					10 Gbps			Single Mode			10 km					
						10G BASE-ER				802.3ae					10 Gbps			Single Mode			30 km
